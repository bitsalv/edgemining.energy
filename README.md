## ⚡ Why Edge Mining?

In many renewable energy setups (like solar or wind), there are periods of excess energy generation that don’t align with consumption. Instead of wasting this energy or investing in expensive storage systems, **Bitcoin mining offers a flexible and profitable way to use it.**

Edge Mining helps:
- Automate the mining process based on solar/battery conditions
- Use surplus energy efficiently
- Reuse miner heat for space heating
- Make mining accessible and useful for small/medium energy producers
