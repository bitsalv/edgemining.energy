    <strong>Edge Mining</strong> is a FOSS project that integrates Bitcoin mining with renewable energy systems.<br/><br/>
    Designed for small and medium-sized power plants, it helps turn excess energy into economic value. Mining is automated based on energy availability, and the heat generated by the miners can be reused for space heating—maximizing overall energy efficiency.
